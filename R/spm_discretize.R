#' Discretize a `sspm` model object
#'
#' Discretize a [sspm][sspm-class] model object with a function from a
#' [discretization_method][discretization_method-class] object class. This
#' function divides the boundary polygons into smaller patches.
#'
#' @param boundary_object **\[sspm\]** An object of class
#'    [sspm_boundary][sspm-class].
#' @param method **\[character OR method\]**
#'    Either a `character` from the list of available methods
#'    (see [spm_methods][spm_methods] for the list) **OR** an object of class
#'    [discretization_method][discretization_method-class].
#' @param with **\[sspm_dataset OR sf\]** Either an object of class sspm_dataset or
#'    a set of custom points.
#' @param ... **\[named list\]** Further arguments to be passed onto the function
#'    used in `method`.
#'
#' @return
#' An object of class [sspm_discrete_boundary][sspm-class] (the updated
#' and discretized `sspm` object given as input).
#'
#' @details
#' Custom discretization functions can be written. The function must:
#'
#' 1. Accept at least 1 argument: **boundaries** (the `sf` boundary object),
#'    and optionnaly **with** (can be NULL) a separate object to be used for
#'    discretization and **boundary**, the boundary column of
#'    **boundaries** (these last 2 arguments are passed and connot be
#'    overwritten but could be ignored).
#'
#' 2. Returns a named list with 2 elements: `patches`. an `sf` object that
#'    stores the discretized polygons, and `points`, an `sf` object that
#'    stores the points that were used for discretization.
