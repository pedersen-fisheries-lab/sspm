Description: Implement a GAM-based (Generalized Additive Models) spatial surplus 
    production model (spatial SPM), aimed at modeling northern shrimp population 
    in Atlantic Canada but potentially to any stock in any location. The package 
    is opinionated in its implementation of SPMs as it internally makes the choice 
    to use penalized spatial gams with time lags. However, it also aims to provide 
    options for the user to customize their model. The methods are described in 
    Pedersen et al. (2022, <https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2022/2022_062-eng.html>).
