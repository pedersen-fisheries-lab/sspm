Description: The goal of `sspm` is to implement a gam-based spatial surplus 
    production model, aimed at modeling northern shrimp population in Atlantic 
    Canada but potentially to any stock in any location. The package is 
    opinionated in its implementation of SPMs as it internally makes the choice 
    to use penalized spatial gams with time lags  based on Pedersen et al. (2020). 
    However, it also aims to provide options for the user to customize their model.
